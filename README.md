Problem Statement 
We intend to perform face recognition. Face recognition means that for a given 
image you can tell the subject id. Our database of subject is very simple. It has 40 
subjects. Below we will show the needed steps to achieve the goal of the 
assignment. 
1. Download the Dataset and Understand the Format 
a. ORL dataset is available at the following link. 
https://www.kaggle.com/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces/ 
b. The dataset has 10 images per 40 subjects. Every image is a grayscale 
image of size 92x112. 
2. Generate the Data Matrix and the Label vector 
a. Convert every image into a vector of 10304 values corresponding to 
the image size. 
b. Stack the 400 vectors into a single Data Matrix D and generate the 
label vector y. 
The labels are integers from 1:40 corresponding to the subject id. 
3. Split the Dataset into Training and Test sets  
a. From the Data Matrix D400x10304 keep the odd rows for training and 
the even rows for testing. This will give you 5 instances per person for 
training and 5 instances per person for testing. 
b. Split the labels vector accordingly. 
4. Classification using PCA 
a. Use the pseudo code below for computing the projection matrix U. 
Define the alpha = {0.8,0.85,0.9,0.95} 
b. Project the training set, and test sets separately using the same 
projection matrix. 
c. Use a simple classifier (first Nearest Neighbor to determine the class 
labels). 
d. Report Accuracy for every value of alpha separately.
5. Classification Using LDA 
a. Use the pseudo code below for LDA. We will modify few lines in 
pseudocode to handle multiclass LDA. 
i. Calculate the mean vector for every class Mu1, Mu2, ..., Mu40. 
ii. Replace B matrix by Sb. 

Here, m is the number of classes, ùúá is the overall sample mean, and ùëõùëò is the 
number of samples in the k-th class. 
iii. S matrix remains the same, but it sums S1, S2, S3, ...S40. 
iv. Use 39 dominant eigenvectors instead of just one. You will 
have a projection matrix U39x10304. 
b. Project the training set, and test sets separately using the same 
projection matrix U. You will have 39 dimensions in the new space. 
c. Use a simple classifier (first Nearest Neighbor to determine the class 
labels). 
d. Report Accuracy for the Multiclass LDA on the face recognition 
dataset. 
e. Compare the results to PCA results. 
6. Classifier Tuning (15 Points) 
a. Set the number of neighbors in the K-NN classifier to 1,3,5,7. 
b. Tie breaking at your preferred strategy. 
c. Plot (or tabulate) the performance measure (accuracy) against the 
K value. This is to be done for PCA and LDA as well.
